    url:
    short-description: The tendency to avoid options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown.[10]
    long-description: The ambiguity effect is a cognitive bias where decision making is affected by a lack of information, or "ambiguity".[1] The effect implies that people tend to select options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is known, over an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown. The effect was first described by Daniel Ellsberg in 1961.

    name: Anchoring or focalism
    url:
    short-description: The tendency to rely too heavily, or "anchor", on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject).[11][12]
    long-description: Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias where an individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (considered to be the \\"anchor\\") when making decisions.\n\nAnchoring occurs when, during decision making, an individual depends on an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Those objects near the anchor tend to be assimilated toward it and those further away tend to be displaced in the other direction. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor. This bias occurs when interpreting future information using this anchor. For example, the initial price offered for a used car, set either before or at the start of negotiations, sets an arbitrary focal point for all following discussions. Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market value of the car.[1]\n\nThe original description of the anchoring effect came from psychophysics. When judging stimuli along a continuum, it was noticed that the first and last stimuli were used to compare the other stimuli (this is also referred to as \\"end anchoring\\". This was applied to attitudes by Sherif et al. in 1958 in their article \\"Assimilation and contrast effects of anchoring stimuli on judgments\\"."
